- Express.js
- Socket.IO
- Docker

## Getting Started
Clone the repository, build the Docker image, and run the application to see real-time features in action. Follow the instructions in the README for setup and usage details.

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.
- Node.js:
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from nodejs.org.
Docker:
Install Docker to create and manage containers. You can get Docker from docker.com.
Git:
Git is required for cloning the repository. If you donâ€™t have it installed, download it from git-scm.com.
Basic Knowledge:
Familiarity with JavaScript and Node.js concepts.
Understanding of Docker and containerization fundamentals.
Text Editor/IDE:
A code editor such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or any IDE of your choice for modifying code and configuration files.

### Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akhiladuvala131/Real-Time-Web-Server.git
cd Real-Time-Web-Server

### Usage
After successfully building and running the Docker container, you can start using your real-time web application. Follow these steps:

Step 1: Open the Application
Step 2: Interact with the Application
Step 3: Test with Multiple Users
Step 4: Monitor Server Logs
Example Interaction:
User A sends a message.
User B, connected to the same server, sees the message appear instantly in their chat interface.
